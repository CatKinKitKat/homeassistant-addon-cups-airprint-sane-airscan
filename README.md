3. Configure networks and options if needed
4. Start the add-on

## Configuration

### Example Configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
share_printers: true
allow_from:
  - "192.168.0.0/16"
  - "172.16.0.0/12" 
  - "10.0.0.0/8"
allowed_networks:
  - "192.168.0.0/16"
  - "172.16.0.0/12"
  - "10.0.0.0/8"
```

### Configuration Options:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `log_level` | Logging level (trace/debug/info/warning/error) | `info` |
| `share_printers` | Enable AirPrint broadcasting | `true` |
| `allow_from` | Networks allowed to access CUPS | Local networks |
| `allowed_networks` | Networks allowed to access SANE | Local networks |

## Usage

### **Printing**
1. Access CUPS web interface at `http://homeassistant:631`
2. Add printers through the web interface or they'll be auto-detected
3. Print from any AirPrint-compatible device

### **Scanning**
1. Scanners are automatically detected via USB and network discovery
2. Use any SANE-compatible software to scan
3. Network scanners work via AirScan/eSCL protocol

### **Network Access**
- **CUPS Web Interface**: Port 631 (HTTP)
- **SANE Network Scanning**: Port 6566
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic via Avahi

## Technical Details

### **Ports**
- `631/tcp`: CUPS web interface and IPP printing
- `6566/tcp`: SANE daemon port for network scanning

### **Volumes**
- Configuration is stored in `/config/cups` for persistence
- Scanner settings are dynamically configured

### **Architecture Support**
- amd64 (Intel/AMD 64-bit)
- aarch64 (ARM 64-bit)
- armv7 (ARM 32-bit)

## Changelog

### Version 1.0.0
- Initial unified release combining CUPS AirPrint and SANE AirScan
- Full sane-airscan support from Alpine edge repositories
- Comprehensive backend support for major printer and scanner brands
- Unified Avahi service discovery for both printing and scanning
- Zero-configuration setup with sensible defaults

## Troubleshooting

### **No Printers/Scanners Detected**
1. Ensure devices are powered on and connected
2. Check USB permissions if using USB devices
3. Verify network connectivity for network devices

### **AirPrint/AirScan Not Working**
1. Ensure `share_printers` is enabled in configuration
2. Check that Avahi service is running
3. Verify network allows multicast traffic

### **Permission Issues**
1. The add-on requires privileged mode for USB access
2. Host networking is required for proper service discovery
