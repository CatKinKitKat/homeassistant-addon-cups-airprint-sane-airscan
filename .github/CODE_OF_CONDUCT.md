# Code of Conduct

## Be Useful

Contribute code, fixes, or ideas. Skip the drama.

## Be Honest

Say what you mean. If something is broken, state it. If you disagree, explain why.

## Respect Others

Disagree on code, not on people. No personal attacks, harassment, or trolling.

## Enforcement

If you're disruptive, you'll be warned or removed. Decisions are direct and fast.
