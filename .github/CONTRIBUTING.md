# Contributing

## How to Contribute

Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request. No need to ask for permission.

## Code

Write code that works. Don't break things. If you do, fix them. Keep commits focused and messages clear.

## Issues

Report real problems. Use the templates. Be direct.

## Conduct

Discuss code, not people. If you're disruptive, you're out.
